# Robot path planning
Maze solving robot system with an intelligent approach based on image processing and a graph theory algorithm.

using four different types of search strategies ` BFS,DFS,A*,GREEDY `.

And two types of heuristic Manhattan and euclidean to solve this maze.

### Simple output:
```
